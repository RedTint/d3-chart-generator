# D3.js Chart Generator
This charting tool is based off of d3.js and is used to generate scripts for building basic to advanced charts.
This project is still in the development phase.


### PROJECT: Build a Charting Tool based off of d3.js

### User Flow:
1. [ ] User: Open Charting Dashboard
2. [ ] User: Select a Chart to use
3. [ ] Page: Shows the chart with dummy data and default configurations
4. [ ] User: Can override configurations in the configurations panel
5. [ ] User: Can provide data to replace the dummy data.
6. [ ] User: Can export script generated for d3.

### Things to think of:
- [ ] Standardize the way data is loaded into charts. Patterned same as Highcharts.js
  - Use [x-axis values, y-axis values]
  - e.g: [dates, values]
- [ ] Standardize the way legends are created in the chart
  - Use [description, color]
  - Standardize the way x and y axis texts are formatted
  - [x-axis formatter, y-axis formatter]
